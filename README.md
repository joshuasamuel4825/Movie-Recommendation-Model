## Team Name
DataBusters - Choosing a good movie is an art, but we can help you master it.

## Objective
To many times we make decisions on movies based on popularity and not actual preferences, from Netflix to Hulu, the need to build an efficient movie recommender system has gained importance over time with increasing demand from modern consumers for customized content. Our goal is to allow users to find movies based on metadata with variable such as genre, cast or directors.

## Data Sources

 One of the most popular datasets available on the web for building recommender systems that we found is:https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ 

 with 1,000,209 movie ratings of 3,900 movies made by 6,040 users


Uisng this data source we are all set to explore the behavioral patterns and the ones of the movies to build a predictive systems for true movie fans. Itâ€™s officially showtime for machine learning

## Selection Process 

* Collaborative Filtering :
Multiple users behaviors create a predictive model. Can be either user-based or movie-based.

* Content-Based Filtering :
Using data provided about the movies to put them into groups that match  users previous preferences
